# Messi-vs-Ronaldo-Dashboard
This is a dashboard that is live on a Python Anywhere server that gives a data science approach to comparing Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.

Through the use of this dashboard we are able to statistically compare which player is better in terms of goal scoring abilities, best in crucial situations 
and consistency. Both players have very different play styles however at the end of the day, hopefully this dashboard will help you make a more informed 
decision as to which player you think is better. With this in mind I created a dashboard to show the following:


Home: This is the homepage which gives a quick introduction to the dashboard and a summary table comparing the two players. 

Goals: Compares goal scoring statistics between the two players in a various of visualizations and analysis.

Consistency: Shows the consistency between the two players including how often they score goals, minutes played per season and how consistently each player plays.

Tournaments: Shows how important each player is in crucial moments, and more specifically tournament rounds where a win is needed.

Goals Prediction: Uses a time-series analysis approach to forecast how many goals each player will score throughout the rest of their careers.
